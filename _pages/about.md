I am a second-year Economics PhD candidate at [Monash University Australia](https://www.monash.edu/business/home){:target="_blank"} and [SoDa Labs](https://www.monash.edu/business/impact-labs/soda-labs){:target="_blank"}. Prior to my PhD study, I completed my pre-doctoral program â€” Master of Economics (Research Option) at [Monash University Australia](https://www.monash.edu/business/home){:target="_blank"}, and accomplished Honours degree (specialised in Economics) and Bachelor degree at [Monash University Malaysia](https://www.monash.edu.my/business){:target="_blank"}.

***Research Areas***: *political economy, environmental economics and applied microeconomics*

I enjoy exploring different types of alternative data and using them in my research to answer social science questions.

I am currently the co-organizer of the [Applied Young Economists Webinar (AYEW)](https://www.monash.edu/business/impact-labs/soda-labs/our-events/applied-young-economists).

I work on a public resource that compiles information about conferences, workshops, and summer schools for my fellow PhD students at Monash.
